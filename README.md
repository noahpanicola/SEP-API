# SEP-API
Back-end to CS4320-FinalProject. 

## Database
We implemented a MySQL database, communicating with the front end through PHP, along with our Java Spring API taking care of the bulk of the backend. Before the application was deployed to AWS, we hosted it locally through MAMP and Apache Tomcat.

## Deployment
We deployed our Web Application through Amazon AWS Elastic Beanstalk. We had to deploy our angular front end, Java Spring API, and PHP, all onto one server, which is why we chose to use elastic beanstalk.
